<h><b>Methods of Preparation</b></h>
<ol>
<li>1)Put all the ingredients in drum.
<li>2)Stir in thirty times clock-wise and thirty times anti clock wise (twice daily).
<li>3)Keep the drum closed.
<li>4)Enriched panchagavya would become ready on 7th day.
<li>5)Mix 100 liters of water and stir it properly.
<li>6)Mix the mixture with vermin-compost or ash or fertile soil and spread it in the field before sowing.
<li>7)During irrigation, make a hole in the drum (4‚Äù above the base) and set it so that dripping from drum starts and 

      whole field will be nourished. By its application at the time of sowing and during irrigations, soil can        

      maintain remain fertile.

<h><b>Advantages of Organic Farming<b></h>
<ol>
<li> 1)Soil health and fertility would revive</li>
<li> 2)Substantial yield may be maintains</li>
<li> 3)Crop will be healthy and free from pest infestation</li>
<li> 4)Crop would mature in time</li>
</ol>

<h><b>Major components of manure</b></h>
<p>The microbial load and nutrient status present in Panchagavya, Beejamrutha, Jeevamrutha and Bidigester are given   

   in Table Nos. 1 and 2, respectively. The data indicates the presence of microflora especially nitrogen fixers and  

   P-solubilizers (Table-1) in all the organic liquid manures in addition both major and micronutrients (Table-2).    

   Presence of naturally occurring beneficial microorganisms predominantly Bacteria, Yeast, Actinomycetes,       

photosynthetic bacteria and certain fungi were detected in organic liquid manures that Panchakavya contains       

Azotobacter, Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria.</p>

<p>Fermented material get ready within 7-10 days, it can apply @ 40-60 liter per acre uniformly in field with    

irrigation water. Regular application of any liquid manure nourished the soil physically and biologically and soil    

start self crop residues decomposition in-situ very rapidly. Within two to three years field soil get healthy and

<h>Banyan Tree Soil</h>
<p>Shady soil of wild old Banyan tree (Bargad) with natural habitat of enormous birds and animals has the special    

quality for improving the agricultural soils due to having heavy microbial biomass. Where they release the excreta    

and soil is undisturbed. This soil contains huge amount of microbes i.e. bacteria, fungus, molds, protozoa and        

algae etc. all these microorganisms liberate no. of minerals, production of antibiotic substrate, synthesis plant     

growth promoter, plant growth regulator, cellulose decomposer and other pathogenic management causes and drives       

congenial environment to soil. Application of 20-kg/ acre shady soil incubated with vermin-compost for three days.    

After this the incubated soil applied as a fertilizer on berseem and other fodder crops. After 35 days the growth     

of biomass of fodder is excellent. Biomass and dry matter is found 1.5 times than conventional practices.</p>
